For that, you need to keep the address for your vehicle registration and driver license current with the DMV. Plus, you also need to keep liability coverage from a company with license by NYS Department of Financial Services and authorized by the NYS DMV.
If you have that situation, you must inmediately surrender your registration and vehicle plates.
Absolutely not. If your intention is to avoid the imposed suspension, the DMV will found that out and will not issue a new registration.
Is your registration still valid?

Do you have valid auto liability insurance coverage?

You can figure it out by when the plate were reported lost/stolen/confiscated; or the registration expires.
Has your registration expired?
You then have to surrender your plates.
No, the DMV will not issue new registration if they determine that the purpose of the new registration is to avoid the suspension.

Besides, you must keep the address for your vehicle registration and driver license current with the DMV, plus have liability coverage from a company licensed by NYS Department of Financial Services and authorized by the NYS DMV.
Do you have or not, a valid auto liability insurance coverage for your vehicle?
I hope you don't get that situation, but if you do, you'll get your driver license and vehicle registration revoked for at least one year. so you better watch out on that..
I sincerely hope you can. Regarding your question, sorry but that answer is no. DMV won't issue a new registration if some kind of attempt for avoiding suspensions is detected.
Well, there's a possibility, but only if you're eligible. If that's the case, you can just pay the optional civil penalty for the entire length of the lapse suspended.

You must provide your loan servicer with up-to-date income and family size information so that your servicer can recalculate your payment. even if there is no change.
if you want a plan your only income based payment plan option is the IBR Plan
One of the conditions is if you filed a federal tax return in the last two years.
in this case your current income is not significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal tax return
ok then This will be your adjusted adjusted gross income or alternative income documentation. we can't help you
ok but decided that an income based payment plan is what you want?
under these conditions it would be: Income - Contingent repayment plan ICR Plan
well these plans consist that the payment is always based on your income and the size of your family, regardless of any change in your income. This means that if your income increases over time, in some cases your payment may be more than the amount you would have to pay under the Standard 10-Year Payment Plan.
Did you file a federal tax return in the last two years?
in this case it cannot be your adjusted adjusted gross income or alternative documentation of income.
Sure, what you have to know is that the amount varies between $ 17,500 or $ 5,000, it all depends on the case.
It is important to note that you must submit eligible loans under the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL Program.
You can choose both plans but not the same teaching service period.
Of course, if in the five-year period, it will not count towards the 120 monthly payments required for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.
You can choose 17500 and you have to show that you qualify for such a plan.
It is noteworthy that the loans range from $ 17,500 to $ 5,000 depending on the case.
Mainly we can say that the AmeriCorps Program cannot be counted for the five consecutive years of teaching required for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program.
You must learn about the forgiveness program to see if you qualify.
in view of your history you may be eligible for forgiveness of up to $ 17,500 on your Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loans and your Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans.
Do you have at least a bachelor's degree?
have you received full state certification as a teacher?

It is important to search for information related to the topic.
For certain procedures carried out on a specific date they are applicable.
It is essential that you go to the financial aid office to request information related to the subject.
Also so far I only have a Notice of approval to apply for residency.
Can't you currently receive federal aid if you are not a US citizen?
Sure, you can search for information in all those institutions.
I can help you with that. First, it's very important to know that being a non-citizen does not automatically disqualify you for aid.
Certain types of documentation can disqualify you. Do you only have a Notice of Approval to Apply for Permanent Residence I-171 or I-464?
Okay. Are you in the U.S. on an F-1 or F-2 non-immigrant student visa?
Do you hold a G series visa pertaining to international organizations?
I'm sorry to have to inform you that this disqualifies you for federal student aid.
Has your green card expired?
Although this still does not qualify you for federal student aid, I advise you to promptly renew your card, if you are able to.
Accept financial aid funds you don't have to pay back above anything else.
Have you received your school's financial aid offer yet?
Your student aid offer will include directions on how to accept the aid offer and you might have to put the amounts you are accepting in an online form and then submit it.
You should always contact the school if you have questions about what aid you are accepting and the repayment terms.
Do you know which student loans you will want?
Are you considering a state, school, or private student loan?
You should learn the differences between federal and other loans then.
Of course. The payments under this plan increase or decrease based on your annual income.
Do you need to make lower payments on your FFEL Program loans?
Under this plan, you'll have monthly payments.
In that case you should contact your loan servicer.
There are several loans which are eligible for the income-sensitive repayment plan, all of them listed on our website.
In that situation I'd recommend you to contact your lender.
Are you looking to make your payments more affordable?
Although you can select or be assigned a payment plan when you start paying off your student loan, you can change your payment plans at any time for free.
